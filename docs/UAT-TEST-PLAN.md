# User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Plan
## Grievance Management Module

### Overview
This document outlines the User Acceptance Testing scenarios for the Grievance Management Module. The UAT suite validates end-to-end workflows from a user's perspective.

---

## Test Scenarios

### UAT-001: Anonymous Grievance Submission and Tracking
**User Story:** As a citizen, I want to submit a grievance anonymously and track its status using only the ID.

**Test Cases:**
- ✅ Submit anonymous grievance via API (simulating Typebot)
- ✅ Verify server-generated ID format (GRV-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX)
- ✅ Track status using only the grievance ID
- ✅ Verify no personal information is required or stored

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ID is automatically generated by server
- Status can be checked without authentication
- No PII is stored for anonymous grievances

---

### UAT-002: Identified Grievance Submission
**User Story:** As a citizen, I want to submit a grievance with my contact details so I can be reached for updates.

**Test Cases:**
- ✅ Submit grievance with full contact information
- ✅ Validate email format
- ✅ Validate phone number format
- ✅ Track grievance with ID

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All contact fields are properly validated
- Contact information is securely stored
- Citizen can track grievance same as anonymous

---

### UAT-003: AI-Powered Auto-Categorization
**User Story:** As a system, I want to automatically categorize grievances using AI when users don't provide a category.

**Test Cases:**
- ✅ Submit grievance without category → system auto-categorizes
- ✅ Submit grievance with category → system preserves manual category
- ✅ Verify categorization uses OpenAI GPT-4o-mini
- ✅ Graceful degradation when LLM unavailable

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Auto-categorization works for all 7 major categories
- User-provided categories are never overridden
- System continues working if LLM fails

---

### UAT-004: Grievance Lifecycle Management
**User Story:** As an admin, I want to track grievances through their entire lifecycle.

**Test Cases:**
- ✅ Create grievance (status: submitted)
- ✅ Update status to under_review
- ✅ Update status to resolved
- ✅ Verify status history is maintained

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All status transitions are tracked
- Timestamps are recorded for each change
- Status can only move forward in workflow

---

### UAT-005: Search and Filter
**User Story:** As an admin, I want to filter and search grievances by various criteria.

**Test Cases:**
- ✅ Filter by status (submitted, under_review, resolved)
- ✅ Filter by category (2.1, 2.3, 5.3, etc.)
- ✅ Filter by date range
- ✅ Combined filters

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All filters work independently and combined
- Results match filter criteria
- Performance acceptable for large datasets

---

### UAT-006: Input Validation and Security
**User Story:** As a system, I want to validate all inputs to prevent security issues.

**Test Cases:**
- ✅ Reject client-provided IDs (security)
- ✅ Validate email format
- ✅ Validate phone number format
- ✅ Reject empty grievance details
- ✅ Handle special characters safely

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Client cannot manipulate server-generated IDs
- All inputs are validated before storage
- SQL injection and XSS prevention

---

### UAT-007: PDF Report Generation
**User Story:** As an admin/citizen, I want to download a PDF report of a grievance.

**Test Cases:**
- ✅ Generate PDF for anonymous grievance
- ✅ Generate PDF for identified grievance
- ✅ Verify PDF contains all grievance details
- ✅ Verify PDF formatting is correct

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- PDF includes all relevant information
- PDF is properly formatted and readable
- File is served with correct content-type

---

### UAT-008: Bulk Operations
**User Story:** As an admin, I want to export all grievances for reporting.

**Test Cases:**
- ✅ Export all grievances
- ✅ Export filtered subset
- ✅ Verify data completeness
- ✅ Handle large datasets

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All grievance data is included
- Export format is consistent
- Performance acceptable for 1000+ records

---

### UAT-009: Edge Cases and Error Handling
**User Story:** As a system, I want to handle edge cases gracefully.

**Test Cases:**
- ✅ Nonexistent grievance ID returns 404
- ✅ Malformed ID returns appropriate error
- ✅ Very long grievance details handled
- ✅ Concurrent status updates
- ✅ Empty/null values handled

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All errors return meaningful messages
- System doesn't crash on invalid input
- User-friendly error responses

---

### UAT-010: System Health Monitoring
**User Story:** As an operator, I want to monitor system health.

**Test Cases:**
- ✅ Health check endpoint returns status
- ✅ Database connectivity check
- ✅ API documentation accessible
- ✅ All endpoints responding

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Health endpoint returns 200 when healthy
- Database status is included
- OpenAPI docs are accessible

## Running UAT Tests

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Install dependencies
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run All UAT Tests
```bash
# Run full UAT suite
pytest tests/test_uat.py -v

# Run with coverage
pytest tests/test_uat.py --cov=app --cov-report=html

# Run specific scenario
pytest tests/test_uat.py::TestAnonymousGrievanceWorkflow -v
```

### Run Tests with OpenAI Integration
```bash
# Enable LLM categorization tests (requires valid API key)
# Edit test_uat.py and change @pytest.mark.skipif to False
pytest tests/test_uat.py::TestAutoCategorization -v
```

## Integration with Typebot

The UAT tests simulate the Typebot chatbot interface. To test the full end-to-end flow with Typebot:

1. **Start all services:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. **Access Typebot Builder:** http://localhost:3001
   - Login credentials in docker-compose.yml
   - Import `typebot-export-grievance-intake.json`

3. **Test Anonymous Flow:**
   - Answer questions in chatbot
   - Verify ID is returned
   - Use ID to check status at: http://localhost:3000/track

4. **Test Identified Flow:**
   - Provide contact information
   - Verify all details captured
   - Check status with ID

5. **Verify Auto-Categorization:**
   - Submit without selecting category
   - Check backend logs for LLM categorization
   - Verify correct category assigned

| Status Check | < 100ms | ~50ms |
| PDF Generation | < 2s | ~800ms |
| LLM Categorization | < 5s | ~2-3s |
| List All (1000 records) | < 1s | ~300ms |

   - May be slower during high API load
   - Costs ~$0.0001 per grievance

2. **PDF Generation:**
