**Important:** 
- Save your tracking ID! You'll need it to check your status.
- Tracking IDs are generated server-side for security
- Format: `GRV-` followed by 26 alphanumeric characters (30 chars total)

### Common Status Values

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Pending** | Just submitted, awaiting review |
| **Under Review** | Being evaluated by case workers |
| **In Progress** | Action is being taken |
| **Resolved** | Issue has been addressed |
| **Closed** | Case is complete |

### Tips

- üí° You can check your status as many times as you want
- üí° Status updates appear immediately when you check
- üí° Keep your tracking ID safe and confidential
- üí° If you get an error, double-check your tracking ID is complete

### Troubleshooting

**Problem:** "I couldn't find that reference"
- **Solution:** Make sure you entered the complete ID starting with "GRV-"
- **Example:** `GRV-01K88MF7431X7NF9D4GHQN5742` (30 characters total)

**Problem:** "Please paste a full GRV ID"
- **Solution:** Your ID format is incorrect. Check that:
  - It starts with "GRV-"
  - It's exactly 30 characters long
  - It contains no spaces

**Problem:** "Our system is busy right now"
- **Solution:** Wait 60 seconds and try again
- The system may be temporarily unavailable

## For Administrators

### Updating Status

**Via External System (Odoo) - Authenticated Endpoint:**
```bash
curl -X PUT "http://localhost:8000/api/status/GRV-01K88MF7431X7NF9D4GHQN5742/status" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ODOO_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "status": "Under Review",
    "note": "Case assigned to social worker",
    "updated_at": "2025-10-23T10:30:00Z"
  }'
```

**Via Internal API (No Auth Required):**
```bash
curl -X PUT "http://localhost:8000/api/grievances/GRV-01K88MF7431X7NF9D4GHQN5742/status" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "external_status": "Resolved",
    "external_status_note": "Issue has been resolved",
    "external_updated_at": "2025-10-23T15:00:00Z"
  }'
```

**Batch Update (Multiple Grievances):**
```bash
curl -X PUT "http://localhost:8000/api/grievances/status-batch" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "updates": [
      {
        "gid": "GRV-01K90BWNRHP3XGS9FSM6H0S8JF",
        "external_status": "resolved",
        "island": "Tongatapu",
        "district": "Lapaha",
        "village": "Lapaha Village"
      },
      {
        "gid": "GRV-01K90C8JA782FM391FFTZ0S20D",
        "external_status": "under_review"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

### Best Practices

1. **Update status regularly** - Keep users informed
2. **Use clear language** - Avoid technical jargon in notes
3. **Be timely** - Update within 24-48 hours of changes
4. **Be specific** - Include actionable information when possible
5. **Monitor frequently checked IDs** - May indicate cases needing attention

### Status Guidelines

**When to use each status:**

- **Pending** ‚Üí New submissions, not yet reviewed
- **Under Review** ‚Üí Case is being evaluated
- **In Progress** ‚Üí Active work is happening
- **Resolved** ‚Üí Issue has been addressed, awaiting confirmation
- **Closed** ‚Üí Case is complete, no further action needed

**Include status notes that explain:**
- What action was taken
- What happens next
- Expected timeline (if applicable)
- How to get more help (if needed)

### Monitoring

Track status check usage:
```bash
# Check API logs for status lookup patterns
docker compose logs api | grep "GET /api/grievances/"

# Count status checks per day
docker compose logs api | grep "GET /api/grievances/" | grep "$(date +%Y-%m-%d)" | wc -l
```
